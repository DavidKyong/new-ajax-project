              You have 13 rounds to attack and defend your side using sharp
              gunplay and tactical abilities. And, with one life per-round,
              you'll need to think faster than your opponent if you want to
              survive. Take on foes across Competitive and Unranked modes as
              well as Deathmatch and Spike Rush.

              let your gunplay shine. No two Agents play alike, just as no two

        <div class="learn-description">
          <p>
            Straight from the files of Brimstone, this is the VALORANT
            Beginner’s Guide. Whether this is your first rotation or you're
            needing a refresher, we figure it’s best you take it from the Agent
            who’s seen it all before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is what to know before your first game. Pay attention. Might
            learn something.
          </p>
          <img src="images/valorant-learn-pic-1.jpg" class="learn-pic" />
          <p>
            Before you enter your first round, you get to pick from a group of
            Agents, each with their own role and special skills designed to work
            alongside each other toward a win. You can dig into the specifics of
            each Agent on our Agents page.
          </p>
          <img src="images/valorant-learn-pic-2.jpg" class="learn-pic" />
          <p>
            After everyone selects their Agent (oh, you picked that one), you’ll
            jump into a random map and formally enter the first round.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start a round as either attacker or defender and switch sides in
            between. Before you do either, you’ll need to navigate the buy
            phase, which lets you purchase weapons and abilities. What you buy
            shapes how you can win. Let style or matchups guide your choices.
          </p>
          <img src="images/valorant-learn-pic-3.jpg" class="learn-pic" />
          <p>
            No one’s going to tell you how to spend your money, but you’re going
            to have to pull the trigger at some point.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s a gun for every situation and you can comb the details of
            each weapon on our dedicated arsenal page. When in doubt, try buying
            based on a weapon’s type and see how it fits your style, expertise,
            and your team’s strategy.
          </p>
          <img src="images/valorant-learn-pic-4.jpg" class="learn-pic" />
          <p>
            Each map is a different stage to style on your enemies. Flex your
            creative skills and savvy gunplay for different encounters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are the basics and you can plot your route using our detailed
            maps page.

            Yeah, you might already know how to frag an enemy six ways from
            Sunday, but Brimstone will tell you, most of those ways are pretty
            noisy.

            No more doubts, you’re ready. But like you, we’re just getting
            started.
